    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Assi Linkedin, a personal project developed by Shankha Dey. This Privacy Policy explains how I collect, use, disclose, and protect your information when you use my app. I am committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring your data is handled responsibly.</p>

    <h2>Information Collection</h2>
    <p>Assi Linkedin may collect the following information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>LinkedIn Account Data:</strong> When you authorize the app via LinkedIn, I may access your basic profile information (e.g., name, email, profile picture) as permitted by LinkedIn’s API.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> I may collect non-personal data about how the app is used (e.g., features accessed) to improve functionality.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I do not collect sensitive personal data beyond what is necessary for the app’s operation.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>Your information is used to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide and maintain the app’s functionality.</li>
        <li>Improve the app based on usage patterns.</li>
        <li>Comply with legal obligations, if any.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>I do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to third parties unless required by law. Your data is only shared with LinkedIn as part of the authentication process, per their terms.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>I take reasonable measures to protect your data, including storing it securely and limiting access. However, no online transmission is 100% secure, and I cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
